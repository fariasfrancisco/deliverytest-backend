# DeliveryTest#
# deliverytest-backend
This is a mock for the back-end of a food delivery system that serves as a hub for multiple restaurants.

this projects uses gradle as a dependecy manager and life cycle manager as well.

By default it expects a MySQL database with a deliverytest schema created. The program will handle all the table creation.


This provides a bunch of end points for a REST API.
